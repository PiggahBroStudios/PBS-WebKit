# Piggah Bro Studios' Web Kit

At Piggah Bro Studios, we like to share how we make our websites great! Every thing we make is easy to use, all you need to do is grab the file, add it to the bottom of your HTML file, follow the short description in the file to make it work, and you're done! The scripts in this project will have a wiki page to describe how they work in better detail! At the bottom of this README is a list of our current scripts!

As you will notice, these scripts will be using a variable called PBS (meaning Piggah Bro Studios) to start up our NEW library called PBSWebKitJS! This will bring better experiance to your development! This library will help you with web development using HTML5!
